/*
The code snippet you provided imports the `@testing-library/jest-dom` library. This library extends the Jest testing framework with additional custom matchers for asserting on DOM elements in your tests.
By importing `@testing-library/jest-dom`, you gain access to a set of useful matchers that can be used to make assertions on the properties and behavior of DOM nodes in your tests. These matchers make it easier to write expressive and readable assertions for your UI components.
For example, it allows you to use matchers like `toHaveTextContent` to assert that a DOM element has a specific text content or `toBeInTheDocument` to check if a DOM element is present in the document.
The comment in the code suggests that you can learn more about the library and its available matchers from the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom).
